# Corporate Use Guidance (HAIA)

This document provides guidance for organizations and enterprises
considering the use of HAIA (Hybrid AI Assistant) in internal or professional contexts.

---

## 1. Intended Use

HAIA is an open-source **support and assistance tool** based on large language models (LLMs).

- It is not a replacement for human judgment or professional expertise
- Final decisions, approvals, and official statements must be made by humans

---

## 2. Nature of Generated Outputs

Outputs generated by HAIA may:

- Contain factual inaccuracies or incomplete information
- Include inferred or extrapolated content beyond the input
- Appear plausible without being reliable or authoritative

All outputs must be **reviewed and validated by qualified personnel**
before being used in any organizational context.

---

## 3. High-Risk and Regulated Domains

HAIA outputs must not be used as a sole source of truth in domains including:

- Legal, contractual, or compliance decisions
- Medical, safety-critical, or life-critical matters
- Cybersecurity or information security assessments
- Incident, accident, or failure investigations
- Public disclosures or official reports

In such cases, HAIA outputs should be treated as **preliminary reference material only**.

---

## 4. Data Handling and Input Responsibility

When using cloud-based AI services, all input data is subject to
the terms and policies of the respective AI service providers.

Organizations are responsible for ensuring that:

- No confidential, personal, or restricted information is improperly disclosed
- Internal policies and applicable regulations are followed

---

## 5. Creative and Narrative Use

Some features of HAIA are designed for creative or narrative purposes.

- Generated content may be fictional or illustrative
- Outputs should not be interpreted as factual representations of real events or entities

---

## 6. Responsibility and Liability

- HAIA is provided under an open-source license on an **"AS IS"** basis
- The developers and contributors assume no responsibility for outcomes resulting from its use
- Organizations must define their own internal governance, usage policies, and accountability

---

## 7. Summary

HAIA is intended to **augment human thinking, not replace it**.

For enterprise use:
- Do not over-rely on generated outputs
- Apply human review and validation
- Ensure final responsibility remains with the organization and its personnel
