Never assign a Male voice to a character marked as '女性'.\n\nOutput ONLY the result in JSON format:\n{\n  \"is_script\": true/false,\n  \"casting\": [\n    {\n      \"character_name\": \"Name or Narrator\",\n      \"assigned_voice\": \"Voice Name from List\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Reason...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
