# Disclaimer

## Purpose and Scope

HAIA (Hybrid AI Assistant) is an open-source desktop application designed to assist users by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and related technologies.

HAIA is provided as a **support tool only**.  
It does **not** replace human judgment, professional expertise, or official decision-making processes.

## No Warranty

This software is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

The developers and contributors make **no guarantees** regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of any output generated by this software.

This disclaimer is consistent with, and does not override, the terms of the MIT License included with this project.

## Nature of AI-Generated Outputs

HAIA utilizes large language models (LLMs), which may:

- Generate factually incorrect or incomplete information  
- Produce plausible-sounding but inaccurate content  
- Infer or extrapolate beyond the provided input  
- Reflect limitations, biases, or errors inherent to the underlying models  

Users are solely responsible for **reviewing, validating, and verifying** all outputs before use.

---

## Use in High-Risk Domains

HAIA must **not** be relied upon as a sole source of truth or authority in domains including, but not limited to:

- Legal, medical, or healthcare decisions  
- Safety-critical or security-critical systems  
- Incident, accident, or failure investigations  
- Cybersecurity or information security assessments  
- Research publications, official reports, or public communications  

In such cases, outputs generated by HAIA should be treated as **preliminary reference material only** and must be independently reviewed by qualified professionals.

---

## Analytical and Creative Content

Some presets and configurations within HAIA are designed for:

- Analytical structuring (e.g., incident analysis, summaries)  
- Creative expression (e.g., scripts, dialogue, narration)  

Analytical outputs do not constitute formal analyses, findings, or conclusions.  
Creative outputs are fictional or illustrative in nature and may not represent real events or entities accurately.

---

## External Services and Third-Party Dependencies

HAIA may interface with external AI services and APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).  
The use of such services is governed by the **terms of service and policies of each respective provider**.

The developers and contributors of HAIA are not responsible for:

- Changes to external services  
- Service availability or discontinuation  
- Data handling practices of third-party providers

## Responsibility of the User

By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that:

- You assume full responsibility for how the software and its outputs are used  
- You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies  
- You will not attribute AI-generated outputs to HAIA as authoritative or definitive results  

---

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,  
the developers and contributors of HAIA shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the use or inability to use this software.

## Final Note

HAIA is intended to **augment human thinking, not replace it**.  
All final judgments, interpretations, and decisions remain the responsibility of the user.
